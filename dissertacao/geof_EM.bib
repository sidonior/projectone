Porém, FWI baseada em gradientes é limitada pela sua bem conhecida sensibilidade no que diz respeito à escolha do modelo inicial. Com o intuito de melhor entender algumas questões relacionadas à convergência do modelo na FWI, nós estudamos uma decomposição baseada na teoria de espalhamento que permite dividir os núcleos de sensibilidade dos campos de onda acústica em função dos parâmetros do modelo em duas partes: uma relativa ao componente de fundo, outra relativa à componente singular do modelo. Estimativas para a perturbação de fundo, bem como para a perturbação da parte singular do modelo obtidas com os adjuntos destes subnúcleos são componentes da estimativa obtida com o adjunto do núcleo total de sensibilidade. Os experimentos numéricos suportam a tese de que a decomposiçao em subnúcleos permite que se retroprojete somente os resíduos do campo de onda espalhado de modo a obter estimativas razoáveis da perturbação de fundo do modelo. Em um experimento com geometria de aquisição restrita (dados de reflexão com afastamento curto), os subnúcleos baseados em espalhamento múltiplo se aproveitam da autoiluminacão do meio devido às ondas multiplamente espalhadas.

	volume = {112},

	abstract = {Optimal control theory is concerned with finding control functions that minimize cost functions for systems described by differential equations. The methods have found widespread applications in aeronautics, mechanical engineering, the life sciences, and many other disciplines. This book focuses on optimal control problems where the state equation is an elliptic or parabolic partial differential equation. Included are topics such as the existence of optimal solutions, necessary optimality conditions and adjoint equations, second-order sufficient conditions, and main principles of selected numerical techniques. It also contains a survey on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory of nonlinear programming in Banach spaces. The exposition begins with control problems with linear equation, quadratic cost function and control constraints. To make the book self-contained, basic facts on weak solutions of elliptic and parabolic equations are introduced. Principles of functional analysis are introduced and explained as they are needed. Many simple examples illustrate the theory and its hidden difficulties. This start to the book makes it fairly self-contained and suitable for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduate students. Advanced control problems for nonlinear partial differential equations are also discussed. As prerequisites, results on boundedness and continuity of solutions to semilinear elliptic and parabolic equations are addressed. These topics are not yet readily available in books on PDEs, making the exposition also interesting for researchers. Alongside the main theme of the analysis of problems of optimal control, Troltzsch also discusses numerical techniques. The exposition is confined to brief introductions into the basic ideas in order to give the reader an impression of how the theory can be realized numerically. After reading this book, the reader will be familiar with the main principles of the numerical analysis of PDE-constrained optimization.},

Since we use rather complete data sets without any spatial aliasing, we do not have the problem of secondary minima (Tarantola, 1986).

	doi = {10.1190/1.1443880},
	abstract = {Iterative inversion methods have been unsuccessful at inverting seismic data obtained from complicated earth models (e.g. the Marmousi model), the primary difficulty being the presence of numerous local minima in the objective function. The presence of local minima at all scales in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum. We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, low‐frequency version of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition by scale. Furthermore, the method greatly reduces the computational burden of the inversion that will be of importance for 3-D extensions to the method.

Using gradient methods leads to iterative algorithms, each iteration implying a forward propagation generated by the actual sources, a backward propagation generated by the data residuals (acting as if they were sources), and a correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained, which gives the updated model. The quality of the results of any inverse method depends heavily on the realism of the forward modeling. Finite‐difference schemes are a good choice relative to realism because, although they are time‐consuming, they give excellent results. Numerical tests performed with multioffset synthetic data from a two‐dimensional model prove the feasibility of the approach. If only surface‐recorded reflections are used, the high spatial frequency content of the model (but not the low spatial frequencies) is recovered in few (≃5) iterations. By using transmitted data also (e.g., between two boreholes), all the spatial frequencies are recovered. Since the problem is nonlinear, if the initial guess is far enough from the true solution, the iterative algorithm may converge into a secondary solution. A nonlinear inversion with 8 shots, each shot recorded at 400 receiver locations, with 700 samples in each seismogram, corresponding to a 2-D model described by 40 000 grid points, takes approximately 1 hour in a CRAY 1S supercomputer.},

	abstract = {The treatment of multioffset seismic data as an acoustic wave field is becoming increasingly disturbing to many geophysicists who see a multitude of wave phenomena, such as amplitude‐offset variations and shearwave events, which can only be explained by using the more correct elastic wave equation. Not only are such phenomena ignored by acoustic theory, but they are also treated as undesirable noise when they should be used to provide extra information, such as S‐wave velocity, about the subsurface. The problems of using the conventional acoustic wave equation approach can be eliminated via an elastic approach. In this paper, equations have been derived to perform an inversion for P‐wave velocity, S‐wave velocity, and density as well as the P‐wave impedance, S‐wave impedance, and density. These are better resolved than the Lamé parameters. The inversion is based on nonlinear least squares and proceeds by iteratively updating the earth parameters until a good fit is achieved between the observed data and the modeled data corresponding to these earth parameters. The iterations are based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The fundamental requirement of such a least‐squares algorithm is the gradient direction which tells how to update the model parameters. The gradient direction can be derived directly from the wave equation and it may be computed by several wave propagations. Although in principle any scheme could be chosen to perform the wave propagations, the elastic finite‐ difference method is used because it directly simulates the elastic wave equation and can handle complex, and thus realistic, distributions of elastic parameters. This method of inversion is costly since it is similar to an iterative prestack shot‐profile migration. However, it has greater power than any migration since it solves for the P‐wave velocity, S‐wave velocity, and density and can handle very general situations including transmission problems. Three main weaknesses of this technique are that it requires fairly accurate a priori knowledge of the low‐ wavenumber velocity model, it assumes Gaussian model statistics, and it is very computer‐intensive. All these problems seem surmountable. The low‐wavenumber information can be obtained either by a prior tomographic step, by the conventional normal‐moveout method, by a priori knowledge and empirical relationships, or by adding an additional inversion step for low wavenumbers to each iteration. The Gaussian statistics can be altered by preconditioning the gradient direction, perhaps to make the solution blocky in appearance like well logs, or by using large model variances in the inversion to reduce the effect of the Gaussian model constraints. Moreover, with some improvements to the algorithm and more parallel computers, it is hoped the technique will soon become routinely feasible.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2478.2008.00698.x},
	abstract = {Waveform (output least squares) inversion of seismic reflection data can reconstruct remarkably detailed models of subsurface structure, and take into account essentially any physics of seismic wave propagation that can be modeled. However the waveform inversion objective has many spurious local minima, hence convergence of descent methods (mandatory because of problem size) to useful Earth models requires accurate initial estimates of long-scale velocity structure. Migration velocity analysis, on the other hand, is based on the Born approximation but is capable of correcting substantially erroneous initial velocities. Appropriate choice of objective (differential semblance) turns migration velocity analysis into an optimization problem, for which Newton-like methods exhibit little tendency to stagnate at nonglobal minima. The extended modeling concept links these two apparently unrelated approaches to estimation of Earth structure: from this point of view, migration velocity analysis is a solution method for the linearized (single scattering, Born) waveform inversion problem. Extended modeling also provides a basis for a nonlinear generalization of migration velocity analysis. Preliminary numerical evidence suggests that this new approach to nonlinear waveform inversion may combine the global convergence of velocity analysis with the physical fidelity of least squares.

	abstract = {The use of actual observations to infer the properties of a model is an inverse problem, which are often difficult as they may not have a unique solution. This book proposes a general approach that is valid for linear as well as for nonlinear problems. The philosophy is essentially probabilistic and allows the reader to understand the basic difficulties appearing in the resolution of inverse problems. The book attempts to explain how a method of acquisition of information can be applied to actual real-world problems, including many heuristic arguments. Prompted by recent developments in inverse theory, this text is a completely rewritten version of a 1987 book by the same author, and includes many algorithmic details for Monte Carlo methods, least-squares discrete problems, and least-squares problems involving functions. In addition, some notions are clarified, the role of optimization techniques is underplayed, and Monte Carlo methods are taken much more seriously.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made in scattering theory since the publication of the first edition of this book fifteen years ago, and it is time to update it. Needless to say, it was impossible to incorporate all areas of new develop­ ment. Since among the newer books on scattering theory there are three excellent volumes that treat the subject from a much more abstract mathe­ matical point of view (Lax and Phillips on electromagnetic scattering, Amrein, Jauch and Sinha, and Reed and Simon on quantum scattering), I have refrained from adding material concerning the abundant new mathe­ matical results on time-dependent formulations of scattering theory. The only exception is Dollard's beautiful "scattering into cones" method that connects the physically intuitive and mathematically clean wave-packet description to experimentally accessible scattering rates in a much more satisfactory manner than the older procedure. Areas that have been substantially augmented are the analysis of the three-dimensional Schrodinger equation for non central potentials (in Chapter 10), the general approach to multiparticle reaction theory (in Chapter 16), the specific treatment of three-particle scattering (in Chapter 17), and inverse scattering (in Chapter 20). The additions to Chapter 16 include an introduction to the two-Hilbert space approach, as well as a derivation of general scattering-rate formulas. Chapter 17 now contains a survey of various approaches to the solution of three-particle problems, as well as a discussion of the Efimov effect.},

In their convergence analysis, they show that if the strict complementarily condition holds, the considered algorithms reduce to an unconstrained calculation after finitely many iterations, allowing fast asymptotic rates of convergence. This paper analyses the behaviour of these iterative processes in the case where the strict complementarily condition is violated. It is proved that inexact Newton methods lead to superlinear or quadratic rates of convergence, even if the set of active bounds at the solution is not entirely detected. Practical criteria for stopping the inner iterations of the algorithms are deduced, ensuring these rates of convergence.},

	Abstract = {Most algorithms for the least-squares estimation of non-linear parameters
	have centered about either of two approaches. On the one hand, the
	model may be expanded as a Taylor series and corrections to the several
	parameters calculated at each iteration on the assumption of local
	linearity. On the other hand, various modifications of the method
	of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently
	run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the
	successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because
	of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In
	this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect,
	performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method
	and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum
	neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate
	representation of the nonlinear model. The results are extended to
	the problem of solving a set of nonlinear algebraic equations.},

@article{raman10,
	Abstract = {The marine Controlled-Source Electromagnetic (CSEM) method is a low frequency (diffusive) electromagnetic subsurface imaging technique aimed at mapping the electric resistivity of the earth by measuring the response to a source dipole emitting an electromagnetic field in a marine environment. Although assuming isotropy for the inversion is the most straightforward approach, in many situations horizontal layering of the earth strata and grain alignment within earth materials creates electric anisotropy. Ignoring this during interpretation may create artifacts in the inversion results. Accounting for this effect therefore requires adequate forward modelling and inversion procedures. We present here an inversion algorithm for vertically anisotropic media based on finite element modelling, the use of Fr{\'e}chet derivatives, and different types of regularisation. Comparisons between isotropic and anisotropic inversion results are given for the characterisation of an anisotropic earth from data measured in line with the source dipole for both synthetic and real data examples.},
